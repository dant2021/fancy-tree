Lets create a plan togehter

Ask me 3 rounds of 5 questions

I can see you're working on a symbol extraction system with language-specific configurations! Let me first understand your current codebase to ask more informed questions.
Perfect! Now I understand your codebase. You're building ctxgen - a tool that extracts code symbols using tree-sitter parsers, and you want to refactor from language-specific extraction functions to a generic, configuration-driven approach.
Round 1: Architecture & Design Goals üèóÔ∏è
Scope of Generification: Are you planning to replace ALL the existing language-specific functions (extract_python_symbols_lightweight, extract_java_symbols, etc.) with the single extract_symbols_generic function, or do you want to keep some language-specific logic for complex cases?
Configuration Storage: Should the LANGUAGE_CONFIGS dictionary live in the Python code (as shown), be moved to the existing languages.yaml, or would you prefer a separate configuration file? What's your preference for maintaining this config?
Backward Compatibility: Do you need to maintain the existing function signatures (like extract_python_symbols_lightweight) for any external dependencies, or are you free to completely replace the internal implementation?
Parser Management: How do you want to handle the get_parser_for_language() function? Should it use the same configuration system, or keep the current approach of individual parser functions (get_python_parser(), get_java_parser(), etc.)?
Signature Generation: The current Python extractor has sophisticated signature extraction (extract_function_signature). Do you want the generic system to support custom signature formatting per language, or standardize on simpler signatures like "function_name(...)" for consistency?
Okay, so scope of generification, basically, we're gonna, yes, replace all the language specific functions into just extract symbol generic, that is correct. Inside the extract symbol generic, we're going to have a possibility to get the parameters. And those will be called by a non-generic function. So basically to get the correct parameters for the class or for the function, these will be done that way. And for the languages that we will, the goal for right now is to implement them in three languages, in Python, in TypeScript, and in Java. And for all the other ones, we can kind of like raise not implemented yet. But these will be the three that we will implement today. Other than that, where should the language configs be? I'm okay with where they are in the YAML, I believe. Or basically, yes, putting them in the YAML makes sense, basically, to me. That is good. Backwards compatibility, we don't need to be backwards compatible. Parser management. Yeah, we should have basically a single kind of parser that just like gets, uses TreeSitter. So basically TreeSitter is our parser, if that makes sense. And this is the great simplification And the great how we simplify our lives is that we don write five parsers but we just call the correct language And this is how we do that Signature generation. This is the part that is basically going to be moved from, that is not going to be inside the extract symbol generic. So extract function signature, That is going to be something that is dealt with in still a language-specific way, but all the other parts are going to be dealt with in the generic symbol. And the other part here is we're going to rename the repository to fancy tree. And so we will kind of re-architect from scratch. And we're going to, of course, take inspiration of what we have now, but it's going to be fancy tree. And the key idea is to use kind of like tree setter, or basically we have like the Git-enabled kind of like tree setter And three, together to kind of like make a useful tool that has low dependencies. And another thing that we need to think about is at the end, we want to publish this as a package that works across language. So the key question there is how do we ensure that we don't have language specific dependencies? Because those would be a problem for users that don't use that language mainly. And so I'd like to think through those topics with you as well.

Excellent! This gives me a much clearer vision. You're essentially building fancy_tree - a git-enabled, cross-language code analysis tool with tree-sitter at its core. The dependency management challenge is particularly interesting for a published package.
Round 2: Implementation Strategy & Dependency Management üì¶
Dependency Isolation: For the cross-language package problem, are you thinking of using optional dependencies (like tree-sitter-python as an optional extra), dynamic imports with try/catch, or splitting into separate packages (e.g., fancy-tree-core, fancy-tree-python, etc.)? What's your preference for handling users who only need Java vs. Python vs. TypeScript?
Configuration Structure: In the YAML, should we extend the current structure to include the node types and signature formats? For example:
Apply to readme.md
Or do you envision a different structure?
Language-Specific Signature Logic: Where should the language-specific signature extraction functions live? Should they be:
Separate modules (fancy_tree/extractors/python.py, fancy_tree/extractors/java.py)?
Methods in a registry/factory pattern?
Inline functions within the generic extractor?
Error Handling Strategy: For unsupported languages, should extract_symbols_generic return an empty list, raise a specific LanguageNotSupportedError, or log a warning and continue? What behavior would be most useful for package users?
Git Integration Scope: You mentioned "git-enabled" - are you planning to add features like analyzing changes between commits, tracking symbol evolution over time, or just basic repo structure awareness? This will affect the architecture significantly.
Yes, so the dependency isolation. Yeah, so basically the way that this should work in my mind is kind of like if we detect the dot pi or a dot js or a dot, whatever the file extension is, we kind of like get the extra dependencies to kind of be able to parse Python correctly. So basically we're going to, as it kind of like gets there, load, kind of like install tree sitter Python and then use tree sitter Python with the kind of like extended version. In my mind, yes, they can be in different folders. That's okay for me. Configuration structure. What you just did is quite beautiful actually for the signature format. I really like that. So that is something that is a very good structure. I'm very happy with that structure. Language specific signature logic. Language specific signature logic I don have an opinion because I don quite see the different methods Like separate modules I understand But can you maybe give me three concrete examples so that I can make a better choice there? Yeah. So with error handling for unsupported languages, we will still extract symbols generic. So it will still work. The only thing that will not work is we will not have the signature format. So kind of signature format will be empty. But all the rest is already dealt with through the configuration structure. And so it's only the signature format that fails. And it's just like after everything is printed, we will show to the user, Hey, signature format has not been implemented for this language. Please contribute on this GitHub, for example. And with regards to the Git integration, right. The reason why I'm saying this with the Git enabled is just like we have, So we're using git ls-files and not tree. And so git ls-files is just aware of git ignore. That is all of it. And if git is not initialized in the REPO, we should just fall back to tree forward slash f to just like get all the files. That's it. Thank you.

Perfect! The dynamic dependency loading is elegant - detect what's needed and install on-demand. And I love the git integration approach - simple and practical.
Round 2 Continued: Signature Extraction Architecture Examples üîß
Here are 3 concrete approaches for language-specific signature logic:
Option 1: Separate Modules
Apply to readme.md
Option 2: Registry Classes
Apply to readme.md
Option 3: Simple Function Registry
Apply to readme.md
Which feels most natural to you?
Round 3: Final Architecture & Implementation Details üöÄ
Dynamic Dependency Loading: Should we check for tree-sitter language packages at startup and show a helpful message about what's missing, or only attempt to load them when we encounter files of that type? What's the best user experience?
Configuration Validation: Should we validate the YAML configuration at startup (ensure all required fields exist for each language), or validate lazily when a language is first used?
Package Structure for fancy_tree: How do you envision the new package structure? Should it be:
Apply to readme.md
CLI Interface: Should the new fancy_tree command maintain the same interface as ctxgen, or is this a good time to redesign the CLI for better usability?
Migration Strategy: Do you want to implement this incrementally (start with one language and expand) or build the full generic framework first then migrate all three languages at once?
Option 2: Registry Classes feel like the right solution. Okay, dynamic dependency loading. Yes, in my opinion, we should check which languages exist at startup, check which file extensions there are, And if there are some missing, kind of add them as we go. Configuration validation. We should validate lazily. Package structure for fancy tree. Yes, I like the package structure you propose. I like it. There will also in core be the core kind of like organization. So we need to also output the file correctly. And the Git integration, actually, don't do a .git. All of this is going to be in core And in core you will kind of have three files One that is getting all the things so this is basically running this git ls thing. What I mean is git ls files, yeah. And then we're gonna have a second file in which we're gonna have the generic extraction logic. Then we're going to have another file with all of the specific extractors in a sense, or we can put them in a different folder. I'm fine with that too. And we're going to have a thing that returns it. So we will return it in kind of like a text version where we also show the indentation correctly. And yeah, I think that's important. Regarding the CLI interface, we can probably, I mean, I'm okay with how it is right now. If you see easy improvements, we can make those. And I think here we need to kind of like build the full generic framework first, because it feels like there's just, it's a big change. So it feels like something that we cannot rebuild just iteratively. And so these are some faults there. Yep. Yeah.

Excellent! The registry pattern with lazy loading and the core-centric architecture makes perfect sense. Building the full framework first is definitely the right approach for this scale of change.
Round 3: Final Architecture & Implementation Details üéØ
Core File Interaction: For the 3 core files, should the flow be:
Apply to readme.md
Where discovery finds files, extraction processes them generically, and formatter handles the indented text output? Or do you envision a different interaction pattern?
Output Format Design: For the indented text output, are you thinking of something like:
Apply to readme.md
What level of detail and indentation style would be most useful?
YAML Configuration Extension: Should we completely replace the current languages.yaml with the new structure, or add the new fields alongside the existing ones? Also, should signature extraction be configured in YAML or kept purely in Python (registry classes)?
Startup Dependency Flow: When we detect missing tree-sitter packages, should we:
Show a summary of all missing packages and let user install manually?
Attempt auto-installation with user permission?
Continue with available languages and warn about unsupported files?
Implementation Starting Point: Within the generic framework, should we start with:
The YAML configuration structure and validation?
The registry pattern and base extractor classes?
The core discovery and file processing pipeline?
What feels like the logical foundation to build upon?
Right. So the flow is correct. Yes, I like that. Basically, the only detail here is that in extraction.py, there might be also the extra data that is kind of like language specific to this call. That's the only thing. The output format design, that's exactly what I'm thinking. Just to make clear here, there will be multiple files like that in multiple different languages as well. So this should just also be reflected somehow in the output format design, just so that we're sure that we kind of capture that intent. And with the YAML configuration extension, yes, we should completely replace it. And the signature, I think, should be configured in YAML. I like that. That is good. Oh, the signature extraction. Signature extraction I don see how we could do that in YAML to be very honest Maybe walk me through how you would do that in YAML and how that would work When we detect missing packages we should attempt auto I think Then within the generic framework Could we... So I think there what's most important here is that you create the full decisions that we've made with this plan and to kind of detail them very extensively in a file. And then what we're going to do is we're just going to set up a whole different file structure and we're going to work in that file structure. And so we're going to create a new kind of like in the root directory, maybe even one directory up. We're going to create a kind of like fancy tree and kind of work in that. And so it's important that we just correctly move those or we can move all the current files In the base directory into kind of like an old version and then recreate a new version with a clear structure that is just named differently with fancy tree. And like this, we can work from there.

Perfect! Let me clarify the signature extraction in YAML approach and then create our comprehensive plan.
Signature Extraction in YAML - Clarification
I think there's a distinction between:
Signature Templates (YAML) - format strings like "def {name}({params}) -> {return_type}"
Signature Extraction Logic (Python) - code that parses tree-sitter nodes to extract name, params, return_type
YAML would contain templates:
